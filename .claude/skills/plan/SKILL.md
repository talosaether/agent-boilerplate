# Plan Skill

Create a structured implementation plan with codebase research.

## Steps

1. Understand the goal: clarify requirements with the user if ambiguous
2. Research the codebase:
   - Find relevant files and modules
   - Understand existing patterns and conventions
   - Identify dependencies and integration points
3. Draft a plan using the structure in `template.md`
4. Present the plan to the user for review
5. Iterate based on feedback until approved

## Rules

- Always ground the plan in actual codebase exploration, not assumptions
- Call out risks, unknowns, and decisions that need user input
- Keep plans actionable -- each step should be a clear, completable task
- Include file paths for all referenced code
